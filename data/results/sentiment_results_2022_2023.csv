The overall stance is slightly hawkish due to inflation concerns, but tempered by the high level of uncertainty and the potential risks of over-tightening.","Monetary policy has to ward off the risk of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations, which could lead to second-round effects in the form of excessive wage and price-setting dynamics.|But the uncertainty surrounding supply and demand dynamics requires us to remain prudent as regards how far the adjustment needs to go.|It would be misguided to base an aggressive tightening on assumptions which cannot be conclusively substantiated."

The speech suggests a cautious approach to policy adjustments, with a potential step down to a 50-basis-point hike, but maintains a firm commitment to tightening until inflation shows a sustained decline.","Despite these actions, I believe that policy is barely in restrictive territory today, so more interest rate hikes are needed to get inflation down.|Looking toward the FOMC's December meeting, the data of the past few weeks have made me more comfortable considering stepping down to a 50-basis-point hike.|I expect that getting inflation to fall meaningfully and persistently toward our 2 percent target will require increases in the federal funds rate into next year."

She acknowledges significant uncertainty in the economic outlook, which complicates precise forward guidance. The speech suggests a focus on raising rates to a restrictive level to ensure price stability, with less reliance on explicit forward guidance given the current economic conditions.","Inflation is much too high, and I strongly believe that bringing inflation back to our target is a necessary condition for meeting the goals mandated by Congress of price stability and maximum employment on a sustainable basis.|If we do not see signs that inflation is moving down, my view continues to be that sizable increases in the target range for the federal funds rate should remain on the table.|To bring inflation down in a consistent and lasting way, the federal funds rate will need to move up to a restrictive level and remain there for some time."
